## ‚ö†Ô∏è GameMaker Studio 2 Notice

These scripts are currently untested and unprepared for GameMaker Studio 2. You may import them into your project and use but they may not work. [We are working on it though](https://github.com/niksudan/prettylight/pull/12)!

## Usage

### Prerequisites (GameMaker: Studio)

- GameMaker: Studio 1
- The required [scripts](https://github.com/niksudan/prettylight/tree/master/prettylight.gmx/scripts) and [shaders](https://github.com/niksudan/prettylight/tree/master/prettylight.gmx/shaders) added to your project
- Light objects
- A view

### Prerequisites (Gamemaker Studio 2)

- [Gamemaker Studio 2](http://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker)
- The required [scripts](INSERT LINK!!!) and [shaders](INSERT LINK!!!) added to your project (You can drag scripts in but you'll have to manually create the shaders with copy/paste)
- Light objects
- A view with a camera

### Registration

You should make use of a game control object to register settings and such for the framework.

- Initialise the system in the **create** event with `pl_init()`
- Process the system in the **step/begin step** event with `pl_update()`
- Render the lights in the **draw** event with `pl_draw()`
- Clear the system in the **room end/game end/cleanup** event with `pl_end()`

### Adding Lights

Initialise a light in the **create** event of a light object with `pl_light_init()`. Make sure that the light object you specify has been registered via `pl_add()`.

**Tip**: Make use of a parent light object to prevent you from having to register every single light object.
